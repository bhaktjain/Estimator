You are a professional construction estimator. I need you to create a detailed renovation estimate for a commercial office space renovation project.

PROJECT: 113 University Place - 2 Floor Commercial Office Renovation
SCOPE: Complete interior renovation including demolition, framing, drywall, ceilings, flooring, painting, electrical, plumbing, millwork, and finishes

I will provide you with:
1. DETAILED TAKEOFF with quantities and specifications
2. INTERNAL MASTER PRICING SHEET with our company's actual rates

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ONLY the pricing from our internal master pricing sheet
- Apply the correct margins as specified in the pricing sheet
- Calculate totals correctly (quantity √ó unit cost √ó (1 + margin))
- Ensure all items from the takeoff are included
- Use the exact item descriptions and specifications from the takeoff
- Apply minimum pricing requirements where applicable

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with this structure:
{{
  "items": [
    {{
      "Category": "Category Name",
      "Room": "Room/Location",
      "ItemName": "Brief Item Name",
      "Description": "Full description from takeoff",
      "Quantity": "Quantity from takeoff",
      "UnitCost": "Unit cost from pricing sheet",
      "Markup": "Margin from pricing sheet (as decimal)",
      "MarkupType": "%",
      "Total": "Calculated total with markup",
      "Confidence": "95"
    }}
  ]
}}

TAKEOFF CONTENT:
{takeoff_content}

MASTER PRICING SHEET:
{pricing_content}

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Use the exact rates from our pricing sheet
- Apply the correct margins (50%, 65%, 70%, 80% as specified)
- Respect minimum pricing requirements
- For items not in pricing sheet, use reasonable market rates but note with lower confidence
- Ensure all calculations are mathematically correct
- Include all items from the takeoff

Please analyze both documents carefully and provide a comprehensive estimate using our internal pricing.
