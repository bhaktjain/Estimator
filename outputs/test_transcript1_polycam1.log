Hi, nice to meet you. you. It'"'"'s nice. I I comes at working. that'"'"'s right. I gave it a little early.
minute I. I like. I never know with you coming up down. I'"'"'m like, it could be 10 minutes on
time or just 20 minutes. I. um, excuse the mass man in the middle of my spring cleaning, so
it'"'"'s a little hot, but. So basically, this is my aunt found this apartment, my grandmothers.
and now it'"'"'s going to be, so, he a littleott, but it'"'"'s definitely like home and I wanted time., I
just not need book storage, clothes storage, and a few little ugly in my favorite. I'"'"'ve been
here since I was a student, so I'"'"'ve been a back of 10 years. so, I know area. I love it, yeah, I
know it feels like home, but I wanna make it a little bit easier for me, so, um just little things.
so tell me what you need I would be like, let'"'"'s kind of go through you tell me everything that
you'"'"'re kind of thinking and I'"'"'ll give you a little bit about what I think I'"'"'m think of video
document everything on scam like all the magents. trust me, this thing is worse. kitchen, so
getting our, so. and it was really old, which I love, but I think it takes up too much space,
probably for the space. Oh, my husband flew out. I don'"'"'t know why, but. a window there.
Okay, you, um a lot like you might? I would I would cook. Um, the other thing that I'"'"' these
two cook and like utility closet. I don'"'"'t know if this is structural or not. like, do we open wall?
Do we get, like a more open station that'"'"'t that'"'"'s fine. Yeah. wall.. So that'"'"'s just there'"'"'s
there'"'"'s lots ofations so that, but then there'"'"'s a little bit longer with time, like a process.. But
they'"'"'re tall, they'"'"'re tall and neat tall, so I mean, there'"'"'s the theme there. It'"'"'s an old prewar
building. Oh, I saw a f. I'"'"'ve actually been seeing more and more than these lately. Yeah,
okay. um, we'"'"'re gonna want an upgrade things.. All right, just think you'"'"'re gonna need
theows a mass. I mean that'"'"'s what everything thing is I know that I'"'"'m going to like it, so Also,
I know it'"'"'s very warming here, so feel free to do. It'"'"'s the sauna. This is the traffic with. so it'"'"'s
an old studio for then they made it into like made it into one bedroom bedroom, just like a
temporary wall. The weird thing is that these this like, structural door, right? with the
archway that'"'"'s open is here, so I don'"'"'t know where there the building in 1941, like was there
a wall fully, I guess? Maybe just bump it out this is. So he bumped this out, so that the bed
would fit. because that is truly a bed. It'"'"'s like very just barely fits a clean bat. But I like it
what it is, and that it keeps an eye like. Yeah, no, I'"'"'m just trying to think is itiss down and
little bit we have, and I guess. Yeah, I would that the only thing that is like do both cases,
like if I gotta make this to more of like. I. And I love them. um, but I need more space for
them, so Where'"'"' you go to school? A grad program and I'"'"'ve studied and I. Oh, cool... Yeah, I
love Parmen Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson. Yeah, I'"'"'ve been a few times. We have we took
tricks, zero arensary school. I don'"'"'t think they'"'"'ve ever been in that building. It'"'"'s like I I got
the name of the famous dean at that time, but he is like I'"'"'ll a Super Bowl real all the
architecture, the schools of buildings and celebr very. I said they all. And UDA and then
that, like big like, some people think about the Okay, so, in general, we want to update the
fourth hour space,, both, do you? I know, so that'"'"'s a port of. Um, my one thought is can I
grow I probably not. Do we sleep over this and. I mean that would probably might need, but
push the frame. These are. These are metal These are metals. So it'"'"'s like it'"'"'s really old, like
it'"'"'s not. I know. listen, these are details that we work out, like it'"'"'s it'"'"'s it'"'"'s more about, like
getting you you know, the preliminary cost of what gonna be, what we'"'"'re supposed to be in.
and then the bathroom just, it'"'"'s it'"'"'s an old prewar, you know, but it'"'"'s like kind of coming to
like 1980s. garbage It'"'"'s, um, laundry, a laundry hamper. Oh, that'"'"'s, it is laundry I'"'"'bage., no'"'"'t
been the wrong idea. it'"'"'s for a. But again, it'"'"'s tight in the need to keep the tub. It'"'"'s hard
because it'"'"'s you know if you ever are you, it'"'"'s it'"'"'s such an old adage thing to say, like,, I don'"'"'t
know. it'"'"'s up to you, like, we always say in the room and say, well, it'"'"'s it only have one after,
it'"'"'s always. but I mean that this is gonna be a family, the world I, we see it really tough to
shower. I'"'"'s six, and I just kind of feel like she'"'"'s gonna live in New York City and whatnot,
so.m in Jersey City, and my mom came over with my Beyian and I'"'"'m celebrated East. were
talking and she was like, you know, I almost walking this in Jersey like 30 years ago. And I
sat here dayream and I was like, I was like, what? Like I maybe there, how would you bought
that place, I I mean, listen, that it'"'"'s a small tub, too. I mean, I think you it might as well just
do it. Well, I would get rid of it. I don'"'"'t know. I mean, do you soak in the tub? Okay. I would
probably do that. And also an elderly first.. I was washer dryer in the bathroom well that
that'"'"'s that'"'"'s the other that'"'"'s the other thing that'"'"'s like it would be somewhere in here, but
there'"'"'s a lot of stage. The other top part is you on napsus to water, so that'"'"'s why that cold.
here would be good and we have thisap in it'"'"'s. beink right there and can go straight all the
that'"'"'s my I guess. like, I think you totally like, it is fine space for your here. Yeah, because
because the comments on the back side here with be very hard to do in there. Um, okay.
and they'"'"'re all anything with the force? It looks like think so. My cousin did down just, so like
10 years ago, and uh you know, it definitely hardware. But was a little a foster, I don'"'"'t know
what happened. I think he painted, and it'"'"'s like throughout the like a m guys are in there it
just kind of get a cold for the.... I think it'"'"'s more like the better of the walls. I can paint. Um,
but, yeah, I mean, I it'"'"'s not like high budget.

You are a professional renovation estimator. Analyze the provided transcript and Polycam measurements to create a comprehensive renovation estimate. Think as an experienced renovation estimator and use the master pricing sheet to identify all possible scope items.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

### THINK AS A RENOVATION ESTIMATOR:
- Review the transcript thoroughly for ALL possible renovation scope items
- Use the master pricing sheet to identify standard items that should be included
- Look for both explicit mentions and implied scope based on project type
- Consider standard renovation practices and what'"'"'s typically included
- **BE EXTREMELY DETAILED** - break down work into specific, granular items
- **MAXIMIZE SCOPE ITEMS** - include prep work, installation, finishing, cleanup for each trade
- **THINK COMPREHENSIVELY** - what would each trade contractor actually do in each room?

### ROOM-SPECIFIC SCOPE REQUIREMENTS:
- **DO NOT COMBINE** scopes for different rooms - provide separate items for each room
- **Kitchen**: Separate items for cabinets, countertops, plumbing, electrical, tile/backsplash, flooring
- **Bathroom 1**: Separate items for plumbing, tile, fixtures, electrical, flooring
- **Bathroom 2**: Separate items for plumbing, tile, fixtures, electrical, flooring
- **Living Room**: Separate items for flooring, painting, electrical, trim
- **Bedrooms**: Separate items for flooring, painting, electrical, trim
- **Closets**: Separate items for storage systems, shelving, lighting
- **Entry/Hallways**: Separate items for flooring, painting, electrical, trim

### MARKUP APPLICATION - APPLY THESE CORRECTLY:
- **Commercial Cleaning**: Apply 75% markup to base cost
- **Tile Work**: Apply 80% markup to base cost  
- **Countertops**: Use special formula: ($1,500 installation + $97/sqft × SF + $2,000 material) × 1.75 markup
- **All Other Items**: Apply 75% markup to base cost

### CALCULATION EXAMPLES:
- Base cost $1,000 with 75% markup = $1,000 × 1.75 = $1,750
- Base cost $1,000 with 80% markup = $1,000 × 1.80 = $1,800
- Countertop 45 SF: ($1,500 + $97×45 + $2,000) × 1.75 = ($1,500 + $4,365 + $2,000) × 1.75 = $7,865 × 1.75 = $13,763.75

### CRITICAL MEASUREMENT EXTRACTION FROM POLYCAM FLOORPLAN:
- **STUDY THE POLYCAM FLOORPLAN CAREFULLY** - look at room dimensions, cabinet layouts, counter configurations
- **KITCHEN CABINETS**: Count linear feet of cabinet runs from the floorplan (base + wall cabinets)
- **COUNTERTOPS**: Measure linear feet of countertop runs from floorplan, convert to SF (multiply LF × average depth ~2.5ft)
- **ROOM AREAS**: Use the actual room square footage shown in Polycam measurements
- **DEMOLITION**: For kitchens, calculate based on ALL items being removed (cabinets LF × $X + countertops SF × $Y + appliances + flooring SF)
- **NO PLACEHOLDER VALUES**: Never use "10 SF", "0-10 FT" or generic measurements - extract real dimensions
- **CABINET LINEAR FEET**: Carefully count cabinet sections along walls from the floorplan diagram
- **COUNTER LINEAR FEET**: Trace countertop perimeter from floorplan, include islands if present

### FLOORPLAN ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- **BEFORE ESTIMATING**: Carefully examine the Polycam floorplan/diagram to understand the layout
- **CABINET LAYOUT**: Look at the kitchen floorplan - count how many linear feet of cabinets are shown along each wall
- **COUNTER CONFIGURATION**: Trace the countertop layout from the floorplan - measure perimeter, include any islands or peninsulas
- **ROOM DIMENSIONS**: Use the actual room measurements shown in the Polycam data, not generic estimates

I work arts, so it'"'"'s not like, not, like, you crazy,
like how long it here from this is the modern, maybe would use them again if there were to
ever sellve, you know, um, is there people are there, so doors. I okay, okay. you, you, I'"'"'m
okay with it close off the bedroom. um yeah, it'"'"'s just a we finish in the wall, and, um washer
dry and.. Yeah.. I could feel that. I don'"'"'t know why did that. I was. Yeah. I ceilings, it'"'"'s an old
building, it'"'"'s reallyurry. I'"'"' top I don'"'"'t know how they do it, but I think. Yeah, I guess. So I was
that have you done that before? I? so what'"'"'s so I believe there'"'"'s many slit that occur before.
Okay. what that means means like those high those high, you know, like AC units that have
like theubvers on it or opens up and out. and that it'"'"'s the important for. um definitely. The
issue with it in some of these large, uh tall buildings like this is you need in the outside the
denser, but because you'"'"'re so close to it you might be able to find the mind. talk part would
be if it'"'"'s a landmark, you know, if this is landmark. Um, only because then it we'"'"'re messing
with massage, like. I just don'"'"'t know. I mean, I think that it'"'"'s just like, it'"'"'s yeah, it'"'"'s just uh it'"'"'s
I think it'"'"'s helpful I chest arms or. um we have a group of bott. It'"'"'s a possibility. I have to do
more research we can. super down standard, yeah., that I guess H. like start out., I like
there'"'"'s a heat coming down from a ri I mean, it really hot, it'"'"'s turned off. It'"'"'s just. Yeah.. And
then in the... So I was just asking about it. It doesn'"'"'t. I know that has, so far as that was
nice, I I'"'"'ll look it. I'"'"'ll look into it. um I don'"'"'t know. I think we'"'"' able to get equipment up
through the surface that are up onto the group. There are some build where we have to
paint it up. this is that., um, okay. I. scam. I'"'"' talk a little bit about process. I mean what what
I'"'"'m preliminar seeing for the cost. um more or less typically when we do a kitchen in the
bathroom, it'"'"'s right around the table. Yeah, I, and even with any of the answers items with
putting on the ceiling we'"'"'re not refinishing the fours, adding the washer dryer, we'"'"'re just
gonna start around., finished materials will need to consider theores. piles in the bathroom
will even as well, uh, like, without high references, what they'"'"' budget is, so we will be
insulute label obviously we'"'"'re included, you know, we base sports, the baseboarding. do for
service, interior design team. We have coordinators that are with their building to get. we'"'"'re
gonna handle everything for you, it'"'"'s just that when you'"'"'re working from design process,'"'"'il..
diner work back like with five, you, like, you like thisile, you like that pile, budget, um and
then that way, and then, you know, as you'"'"'re going to the process, you kind of understand
like, I like that ti, we don'"'"'t really want to push into thisrial, you want to sit and then do that
way. um other than that, just appliances in the kitchen, um, like the new dishwasher, um,
this thing the stove um, I think you already have a micram somewhere, so we find there.? I
am I kind of don'"'"'t use it that often again, I would do like if I whatever. salad would eat. Yeah,
I mean But it works. Yeah, and it'"'"' gas, I would. that if you lost power, you can still need
spaghetti. I never thought about it like that. Just to use, you know, people to eat., when the
power broke up you could turn the yellow.. That'"'"'s a little biter. um, yeah, I mean, again,
everything that I'"'"'m mentioning, there are ways to kind of around ways of scale.. You know,
the tough part about the map is we'"'"'re gonna come to go in it. I mean the tile, like, the dumb
room repairs, but it doesn'"'"'t have the color, like the ground is like they'"'"', you know, it needs a
little fluff. polished., for sure. I like the purple. That man, the watch the product. I mean, I
think all the, like kind of finish seeing, I think is the so it'"'"'s a small bathroom, I think with it
kind of it clean probably, that'"'"'s, or finish material, and again, that budget is like the course,
they can go out. so right there, the Again, so the marriage just want to seege you a little bit
of numbers for because we'"'"'re gonna be on Wednesday Did you get the invite? I thank you
for communic as I didn'"'"'t want to meet you on Monday and doing okay.. is that that an
additional you going to go walls, practically to get for the most part, we'"'"'ve the most likely do
it locally, I'"'"'ll double check with you. I'"'"'m gonna say it for you. but we this a few times. um it'"'"'s
more important that people'"'"' old. um but yeah, whatever want to helpade, especially for
adding in the Schwap if what we'"'"'re doing is and the washer dryers likeate lines, back to the
panel, because we don'"'"'t want the dug more out and that blows like, everything'"'"'t wanna
make sure... I give line put it in the, so we have lot of local vetors in the area. options, so in
and I just want also verify that so in that kind of hundred,000, I was saying for both these
areas, the kitchen category is all so that'"'"'s not separate. so we have bors that we'"'"' work with,
between the jersey, for I designed everything. And you'"'"'ll work with the designers that make
it, like, the best of what it works with you.. competition, I'"'"'t. We don'"'"'t like you know, we need
to kind of understand it general. We need, um, for the most part is kind of like, whatever. I
think maximizing vertical storage is a Yeah, you know what'"'"'s funny that people do you see?

amazing going see toilet pictures, but like, and like pul sits in things like these, but you'"'"'ll
paying the money and you wanna see what you'"'"'re buying, you'"'"'re well. so you'"'"'re kind of let
me back up a second. so once you start with design, we kind of ask your aesthetic five, you
know, are you more, you know, black and white, you have colors? And then from there, you
know, they'"'"'ll look for the scope of work and for years of bathroom and, those are the main
focusaries that are gonna be. Right. There are some the factors of both, they'"'"'re gonna use

Um, and then they'"'"'re gonna kind of
give you a first pass of the design, you know, we'"'"'re gonna say yes, no, and then we'"'"'ll start to
kind of put together the square footages of, like,, you know, four tile do we need and the
bathroom or tile do we need any? wall tile in the bathroom? the height of the backsplash
and the kitchen, you know, a lot of these finite and technical items. um, and then once you
go through that, you just like the materials, we askrove, improve them again then gonna be
a change order after we'"'"'re. So that whole process right there is gonna take about few
months. And the reason I say that is simultaneously our project coordinator is gonna be
working for something. Right, so we have to tell them what we'"'"'re doing in here, how long it'"'"'s
anticipated the to lab. you know, like, we'"'"'re not moving new walls, like it'"'"'s just likeating blah
blah, we wanna reado theapp. That'"'"'s it. fix this. That'"'"'s. Um, sometimes it takes some a
while to kind out of that right. we typically see anywhere from me to 12 weeks. So, typically
that'"'"'s a good phase for a redesign, right? There'"'"'s a lot of work and kind of do front and
you'"'"'re obviously a lot of about your work right now is the more work you do upri, easier it is
to come in here and not out work. Like, if we'"'"'re still making materials and doing this, if you
want to start, you like, you have some client that are just so adamant, they'"'"'re like, I need to
start on this like, you get we'"'"'re gonna we can start now, but in three weeks, we'"'"'re gonna be
ready for the things that you can hit, and they'"'"'re not delivered and they'"'"'re not paid for, like,
it just kind of gets a little short. So, when you have a little bit of trust and I was knowing that
the process has to really be planned out first, you know, and then we also don'"'"'t want you to
leave further than you have to, right? So during that time in the predesign, we'"'"'re kind of
understanding the schedule. getting this out on board it, and then we'"'"'ll kind of give you, you
know, the warning of like, hey, this is what we'"'"'re anticipating, we'"'"'re anticipating the building
approval the next two, three weeks. you know we'"'"'re ready to start three weeks after that,
you know, this is maybe when you want to get apartment. that, restore that what happened
back. construction suspension when they were, I I would say it would be around. Um you
don'"'"'t ever like to tell you less and not help you understand it could be free. Um is a very
straightforward scope, but would happen sometimes when we'"'"'re arguing we'"'"' coming, we
have to shut down the water and like, there'"'"'s a lot that goes into it. sometimes it takes a few
information from like it down today or someone else might be doing the water down to the
moon like there'"'"'s something. I love my super. He was a a man for a long time he'"'"' been with
the building, since my grandma was here, actually, so he'"'"'s fantastic. He'"'"'s like very, like
ready. I haven'"'"'t told him, that I I'"'"'ve been to of this yet, so he'"'"'ll be like, what? hopefully he
really liked you and your grandma because we want to be his best friend. Oh my, he'"'"'s just
like such a cool guy, too, so it'"'"'s, I don'"'"'t know, you hear these nightmare stories about
supers and buildings and like make you to go. I know. Like some of them are like give me to
come up and it you like like really great. I think he'"'"'d be totally on board with this and he
would work with you. basically, again, I kind of talk with the building property manager or
the building team, and then we also work with the super, you know, obviously we want the
best friends with them. um, we wanted to respect them, make sure they understand what
we'"'"'re doing, if they'"'"'re having any questions this we'"'"'re an open bulk, like we come up here
and we use license which is licensed farmers, uh certified farmers, licensedation, certified
electric we don'"'"'t really hide anything? Um I'"'"'m just like a little scared about if you open the
wall, like what would you find? Like the wire gonna get the variability deal? I wish that you
before, and you know, like as big a deal. I mean, I mean and and the other part, too, right, is
when we'"'"'re working through, this is very old. So, even when we start to upgrade it, we'"'"'ll hold
the ws, we'"'"'ll have to replace some new back to the big appliance items. construction that
everything goes to the land. So we just make sure.. I watch HGTV, if that gives you any
comfort. I do. I know, but it'"'"'s not real life, but it isives you a little bit of an ankling in terms of
it'"'"'s fun. Um, that thank you. so much for having me so bright and early on on Monday. This
was this was hop for me. Thank you for having me early. I have all the notes, um I'"'"'m gonna
start putting everything together. You'"'"'ve got the email for Wednesday, um, has a zoom link
for just pop on zoom, we'"'"'ll take me to 30 45 minutes coming and go through everything.
um, you should also get an invite for a client portal, and the next few days, um, should pop
out maybe today. Have a look through it it'"'"'s very interactive. um personalized portal that we
face specifically forcover. and that'"'"'s how you'"'"'re gonna kind of manage the whole
renovation, um, for all your material selections will go through there all the financial
models will be in there, stealy site photo upload the when we'"'"'re working throughout the
progress of it'"'"'s kind of your centralized area just need to everything. Um, so it'"'"'ll be very
helpful. There'"'"'ll be a demo on there. and I say that cause once we'"'"'re done, we'"'"'re reviewing
the proposal, I'"'"'ll release it to your portal and you kind of get out with the. I'"'"'ll image you be.
So, I I like I said, I was I and this is being very, real with you. I was workingiffany and they'"'"'
working me like a dog. I was making a lot of money and I'"'"'ve learned a lot of times in my life
when I'"'"'ve jumped for money. I'"'"'ve never I actually been really sad. Like I it doesn'"'"'t make me
happy. and the two times I'"'"'ve jumped for less money. I'"'"'ve been so much more happier. And
like also, like, we were planning our wedding and I'"'"'m flying to Vegas.

You are a professional renovation estimator. Analyze the provided transcript and Polycam measurements to create a comprehensive renovation estimate. Think as an experienced renovation estimator and use the master pricing sheet to identify all possible scope items.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

### THINK AS A RENOVATION ESTIMATOR:
- Review the transcript thoroughly for ALL possible renovation scope items
- Use the master pricing sheet to identify standard items that should be included
- Look for both explicit mentions and implied scope based on project type
- Consider standard renovation practices and what'"'"'s typically included
- **BE EXTREMELY DETAILED** - break down work into specific, granular items
- **MAXIMIZE SCOPE ITEMS** - include prep work, installation, finishing, cleanup for each trade
- **THINK COMPREHENSIVELY** - what would each trade contractor actually do in each room?

### ROOM-SPECIFIC SCOPE REQUIREMENTS:
- **DO NOT COMBINE** scopes for different rooms - provide separate items for each room
- **Kitchen**: Separate items for cabinets, countertops, plumbing, electrical, tile/backsplash, flooring
- **Bathroom 1**: Separate items for plumbing, tile, fixtures, electrical, flooring
- **Bathroom 2**: Separate items for plumbing, tile, fixtures, electrical, flooring
- **Living Room**: Separate items for flooring, painting, electrical, trim
- **Bedrooms**: Separate items for flooring, painting, electrical, trim
- **Closets**: Separate items for storage systems, shelving, lighting
- **Entry/Hallways**: Separate items for flooring, painting, electrical, trim

### MARKUP APPLICATION - APPLY THESE CORRECTLY:
- **Commercial Cleaning**: Apply 75% markup to base cost
- **Tile Work**: Apply 80% markup to base cost  
- **Countertops**: Use special formula: ($1,500 installation + $97/sqft × SF + $2,000 material) × 1.75 markup
- **All Other Items**: Apply 75% markup to base cost

### CALCULATION EXAMPLES:
- Base cost $1,000 with 75% markup = $1,000 × 1.75 = $1,750
- Base cost $1,000 with 80% markup = $1,000 × 1.80 = $1,800
- Countertop 45 SF: ($1,500 + $97×45 + $2,000) × 1.75 = ($1,500 + $4,365 + $2,000) × 1.75 = $7,865 × 1.75 = $13,763.75

### CRITICAL MEASUREMENT EXTRACTION FROM POLYCAM FLOORPLAN:
- **STUDY THE POLYCAM FLOORPLAN CAREFULLY** - look at room dimensions, cabinet layouts, counter configurations
- **KITCHEN CABINETS**: Count linear feet of cabinet runs from the floorplan (base + wall cabinets)
- **COUNTERTOPS**: Measure linear feet of countertop runs from floorplan, convert to SF (multiply LF × average depth ~2.5ft)
- **ROOM AREAS**: Use the actual room square footage shown in Polycam measurements
- **DEMOLITION**: For kitchens, calculate based on ALL items being removed (cabinets LF × $X + countertops SF × $Y + appliances + flooring SF)
- **NO PLACEHOLDER VALUES**: Never use "10 SF", "0-10 FT" or generic measurements - extract real dimensions
- **CABINET LINEAR FEET**: Carefully count cabinet sections along walls from the floorplan diagram
- **COUNTER LINEAR FEET**: Trace countertop perimeter from floorplan, include islands if present

### FLOORPLAN ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- **BEFORE ESTIMATING**: Carefully examine the Polycam floorplan/diagram to understand the layout
- **CABINET LAYOUT**: Look at the kitchen floorplan - count how many linear feet of cabinets are shown along each wall

- Tile Work: 80% markup  
- Countertops: Special formula with 75% markup
- All Others: 75% markup

### THINK AS A RENOVATION ESTIMATOR:
- What would a professional estimator include in this type of project?
- What are the standard items for kitchen/bathroom/full gut renovations?
- What items might be implied but not explicitly mentioned?
- Use your experience to identify comprehensive scope items
- **IMPORTANT**: Provide separate scope items for each room - do not combine them

Remember: The markups must be applied correctly in your calculations, not just listed in the markup field. '
